### Description

Hi! Due to some enhancements needed in my applications, I decided to do improvements in XChart.

I had no time to implement requirements coming from PSC users, but some significant changes were made,

above all regarding the GUI and the printing.

Also, I needed two more OCX for viewing data through 2D-pie (XPie) and a chartesian plan (XQuadrant),

showing data in four quadrants.

I'ts quite difficult to explain the capabilities of all the OCXs, so I let the pictures speak!

I tested them hardly (WinXP, Win2000 and WINNT), since I has to release them in a package, so I hope they're fully bug free.

Please let me know if it's all ok or some bugs are present again.

I'm very sorry for not implementing all PSC users' requirements, but I think to have produced

a couple of useful OCXs, to enable users a good way of data presentation.
